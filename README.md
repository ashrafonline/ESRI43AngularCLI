# Concept 

In this repository , I'm giving an example in how we can use ArcGIS JS API 4.3 inside the lovely AngularCLI .

I'm using [@tomwayson](https://github.com/tomwayson) modules : 

[esri-loader](https://github.com/tomwayson/esri-loader) AND [angular2-esri-loader](https://github.com/tomwayson/angular2-esri-loader)

Currently , I'm focusing on three types of services : MapImageLayer,TileLayer and FeatureLayer . But the component is flexible and could be extended easily .
